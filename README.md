## Be Warned!

**Contracts are prescription-strength legal devices.  If you need terms for exchanging confidential information, don't be an idiot.  Hire a lawyer.  A good one will ask good questions.  They may very well decide an RxNDA form meets your needs.**

**Do _not_ put confidential information about you, your work, or your clients in issues or pull requests.  Do _not_ ask for legal advice on GitHub, or try to disguise requests for legal advice as general questions or hypotheticals.  You don't want legal advice from anybody dumb enough to fall for that.**

## In Brief

The RxNDA form nondisclosure agreements are generic nondisclosure agreements, or "NDAs", that aim to be:

- orthodox in substance, ticking all the boxes for NDAs used routinely between United States companies before exploring a sale or collaboration
- relatively modern in style, eschewing WHEREASes, NOW THEREFOREs, nonsensical recitations of consideration, and other egregious anachronisms, but otherwise taking a prototypically lawyerly tone
- generic enough to reuse throughout United States jurisdictions

RxNDA form nondisclosure agreements do _not_ aim to cover situations where specialized, customized, or highly negotiated nondisclosure agreements are the rational norm, such as agreements:

- incorporating non-compete, non-solicitation, or no-hire provisions
- in anticipation of potential M&A transactions
- between clients and professional advisers or firms, such as banks acting as underwriters or brokers
- pertaining to specially regulated personal data, such as health or financial data
- pertaining to restricted military or government information, such as classified information
- between counterparties spanning national jurisdictions

## Variants

RxNDA form nondisclosure agreements come in several variants, each developed in its own Git repository.  Each variant is identified with a unique code, like `B-2W-B2B` or `N-1W-B2I`.

|---------|-----|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| One-Way | B2B | [B-1W-B2B](https://github.com/rxnda/B-1W-B2B) | [N-1W-B2B](https://github.com/rxnda/N-1W-B2B) |
|         | B2I | [B-1W-B2I](https://github.com/rxnda/B-1W-B2I) | [N-1W-B2I](https://github.com/rxnda/N-1W-B2I) |
|         | I2B | [B-1W-I2B](https://github.com/rxnda/B-1W-I2B) | [N-1W-I2B](https://github.com/rxnda/N-1W-I2B) |
|         | I2I | [B-1W-I2I](https://github.com/rxnda/B-1W-I2I) | [N-1W-I2I](https://github.com/rxnda/N-1W-I2I) |
| Two-Way | B2B | [B-2W-B2B](https://github.com/rxnda/B-2W-B2B) | [N-2W-B2B](https://github.com/rxnda/N-2W-B2B) |
|         | B2I | [B-2W-B2I](https://github.com/rxnda/B-2W-B2I) | [N-2W-B2I](https://github.com/rxnda/N-2W-B2I) |
|         | I2B | [B-2W-I2B](https://github.com/rxnda/B-2W-I2B) | [N-2W-I2B](https://github.com/rxnda/N-2W-I2B) |
|         | I2I | [B-2W-I2I](https://github.com/rxnda/B-2W-I2I) | [N-2W-I2I](https://github.com/rxnda/N-2W-I2I) |

The codes are easy to read.  For example:

    B      -      2W      -      B2B
    
    Broad         Two-Way        Business-to-Business

The `B-2W-B2B` form defines "Confidential Information" broadly, covers Confidential Information disclosed by both parties, and expects both parties to be businesses entities, rather than individuals.

On the other hand:

    N      -      1W      -      B2I
    
    Narrow        One-Way        Business-to-Individual

The `N-1W-B2I` form defines "Confidential Information" more narrowly, covers Confidential Information disclosed only by the first, proposing party to the second, and expects the disclosing party to be a business and the receiving party to be an individual.
